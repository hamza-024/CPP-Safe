## Program Structure

C++Safe improves the program structure by focusing on readability and eliminating boilerplate. It allows a cleaner top-level organization without requiring extensive use of `#include` directives or verbose main function syntax.

```ebnf
Program         ::= Statement+
Statement       ::= VariableDeclaration
                 | FunctionDeclaration
                 | ControlFlowStatement
                 | ExpressionStatement
                 | ClassDeclaration
                 | MemorySafetyStatement
```

---

## Statements

C++Safe introduces a more intuitive and concise syntax for variable declarations and expression-based statements.

### Variable Declarations
- **Improvement**:
  - Replaces `int x = 10;` with `let x = 10;`, eliminating type verbosity when the type can be inferred.
  - Introduces `const` for immutable variables to encourage safer practices.

```ebnf
VariableDeclaration ::= "let" Identifier (":" Type)? "=" Expression ";"
ConstantDeclaration ::= "const" Identifier (":" Type)? "=" Expression ";"
```

Examples:
```cpp
let x = 10;               // Implicit type
let y: float = 3.14;      // Explicit type
const pi = 3.14159;       // Constant
```

### Expressions as Statements
- **Improvement**:
  - Allows any valid expression to be a standalone statement (e.g., `print` or function calls), reducing verbosity.

```ebnf
ExpressionStatement ::= Expression ";"
```

Example:
```cpp
print("Hello, world!");
```

---

## Expressions

C++Safe enhances expressions by simplifying literals, identifiers, and function calls while maintaining flexibility.

### General Expression Rules
- **Improvement**:
  - Simplifies the grammar for literals and identifiers, making them consistent and less prone to errors.
  - Function calls are made clearer and less verbose than standard C++.

```ebnf
Expression          ::= PrimaryExpression
PrimaryExpression   ::= Literal
                      | Identifier
                      | "(" Expression ")"
                      | FunctionCall
```

### Literals
- **Improvement**:
  - Uses Python-like literals for strings and numbers, improving readability.

```ebnf
Literal             ::= IntegerLiteral
                      | FloatLiteral
                      | StringLiteral
IntegerLiteral      ::= Digit+
FloatLiteral        ::= Digit+ "." Digit+
StringLiteral       ::= '"' (Character)* '"'
Digit               ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
```

Examples:
```cpp
42
3.14
"Hello, World!"
```

### Function Calls
- **Improvement**:
  - Simplifies syntax by making function calls consistent and requiring fewer parentheses.

```ebnf
FunctionCall        ::= Identifier "(" (Argument ("," Argument)*)? ")"
Argument            ::= Expression
```

Example:
```cpp
print("Hello, World!");
add(3, 5);
```

---

## Functions

Functions in C++Safe are easier to write and read, with concise syntax and optional return type specifications.

- **Improvement**:
  - Replaces verbose function declarations with the `func` keyword, inspired by modern languages like Swift.
  - Simplifies lambda expressions and allows inline return statements.

```ebnf
FunctionDeclaration ::= "func" Identifier "(" (Parameter ("," Parameter)*)? ")" (":" Type)? Block
Parameter           ::= Identifier ":" Type
Block               ::= "{" Statement+ "}"
```

Example:
```cpp
func add(a: int, b: int): int {
    return a + b;
}
```

---

## Control Flow

Control flow in C++Safe is streamlined for readability and intuitive behavior.

### If-Else Statements
- **Improvement**:
  - Eliminates the need for parentheses around conditions and simplifies block syntax.

```ebnf
ControlFlowStatement ::= IfStatement
IfStatement          ::= "if" Expression Block ("else" Block)?
```

Example:
```cpp
if x > 0 {
    print("Positive");
} else {
    print("Non-positive");
}
```

### Loops
- **Improvement**:
  - Introduces Python-style `range` for loops, making iteration over sequences intuitive and less error-prone.

```ebnf
ControlFlowStatement ::= ForLoop | WhileLoop
ForLoop              ::= "for" Identifier "in" Range Block
WhileLoop            ::= "while" Expression Block
Range                ::= "range" "(" Expression "," Expression ")"
```

Examples:
```cpp
for i in range(1, 10) {
    print(i);
}

while counter < 5 {
    counter += 1;
}
```

---

## Classes

C++Safe simplifies class definitions and improves encapsulation.

- **Improvement**:
  - Combines the header and implementation into a single definition, eliminating the need for `.h` and `.cpp` files.
  - Simplifies member variable declarations and method syntax.

```ebnf
ClassDeclaration ::= "class" Identifier "{" ClassBody "}"
ClassBody        ::= (ClassVariable | FunctionDeclaration)*
ClassVariable    ::= "let" Identifier ":" Type ";"
```

Example:
```cpp
class Point {
    let x: int;
    let y: int;

    func move(dx: int, dy: int): void {
        x += dx;
        y += dy;
    }
}
```

---

## Memory Safety

Memory safety is a core feature of C++Safe, eliminating the risk of dangling pointers and memory leaks.

- **Improvement**:
  - Introduces the `safe` keyword for automatic memory management, replacing raw pointers with smart pointers.

```ebnf
MemorySafetyStatement ::= "let" Identifier "=" "safe" "<" Type ">" "(" Expression? ")" ";"
```

Example:
```cpp
let ptr = safe<int>(42);
```

---

## Concurrency

Concurrency in C++Safe is modernized, inspired by asynchronous programming paradigms in Python and JavaScript.

### Async and Await
- **Improvement**:
  - Introduces `async` and `await` for non-blocking code execution, reducing complexity.

```ebnf
ConcurrencyStatement ::= AsyncFunction
AsyncFunction        ::= "async" Identifier "(" ")" Block
AwaitExpression      ::= "await" Identifier "(" ")"
```

Example:
```cpp
async fetchData() {
    let data = await getData();
    print(data);
}
```

### Threads
- **Improvement**:
  - Simplifies thread creation and management with the `spawn` keyword.

```ebnf
ConcurrencyStatement ::= "thread" Identifier "=" "spawn" Block
```

Example:
```cpp
thread t = spawn {
    print("Running in a separate thread!");
};
t.join();
```

---

## Example Program

Here is a small example program demonstrating the C++Safe syntax and grammar:
```cpp
func main(): void {
    let x = 10;
    let y: float = 20.5;
    print("Sum:", x + y);

    for i in range(1, 5) {
        print("Iteration:", i);
    }

    if x > 5 {
        print("x is greater than 5");
    } else {
        print("x is 5 or less");
    }

    let result = safe<int>(42);
    print("Safe value:", result);
}
```

## Conclusion

This grammar specification provides the foundation for parsing and implementing the C++Safe language. It improves upon traditional C++ by focusing on safety, simplicity, and modern programming paradigms.
