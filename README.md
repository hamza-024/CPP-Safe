# C++Safe

C++Safe is a modern extension of C++ designed to improve safety, simplify syntax, and enhance productivity. It enforces safe memory management and introduces cleaner, user-friendly syntax.

---

## Features
- **Automated Memory Safety**: Say goodbye to raw pointers. With `safe`, memory management is simple and secure.
- **Simplified Syntax**: Write more concise and readable code with features like `print` for streamlined output.
- **Streamlined Concurrency**: Leverage modern programming paradigms with macros like `async_task` and `spawn` for asynchronous programming and threading.
- **Powerful Slicing and Ranges**: Simplify data manipulation and iteration with Python-like slicing and custom ranges.
- **Inline Testing**: Add lightweight, inline tests directly into your code for improved debugging and validation.
