# C++Safe

C++Safe is a modern extension of C++ designed to improve safety, simplify syntax, and enhance productivity. It enforces safe memory management and introduces cleaner, user-friendly syntax.

---

## Features
- **Automated Memory Safety**: Say goodbye to raw pointers. With `safe`, memory management is simple and secure.
- **Simplified Syntax**: Write more concise and readable code with features like `print` instead of `std::cout`.
- **Concurrency Simplified**: Leverage modern programming paradigms with first-class support for `async` and `await`.
